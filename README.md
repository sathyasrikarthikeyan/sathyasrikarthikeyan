### About Me

I am a passionate Computer Science graduate with a strong foundation in programming, automation testing, and cloud technologies. I enjoy solving complex problems through clean, efficient code and continuously learning cutting-edge technologies. My journey so far includes hands-on experience with Java, Python, Selenium, and AWS, alongside building projects that involve data pipelines and AI-powered solutions.

As a CodeCircuit Hackathon finalist, I thrive in fast-paced environments that challenge me to innovate and collaborate. I’m always eager to contribute to meaningful open-source projects and expand my skill set through real-world applications. When I’m not coding, I like to participate in coding contests, explore new tech trends, and share knowledge with the developer community.

I believe in writing scalable, maintainable code and using technology to make a positive impact. Feel free to connect with me—I’m always open to exciting collaborations and opportunities!
